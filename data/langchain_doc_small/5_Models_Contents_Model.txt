Conceptual Guide

This section of the documentation deals with different types of models that are used in LangChain.
On this page we will go over the model types at a high level,
but we have individual pages for each model type.
The pages contain more detailed “how-to” guides for working with that model,
as well as a list of different model providers.




Getting Started: An overview of the models.


Model Types#

LLMs: Large Language Models (LLMs) take a text string as input and return a text string as output.
Chat Models: Chat Models are usually backed by a language model, but their APIs are more structured.
Specifically, these models take a list of Chat Messages as input, and return a Chat Message.
Text Embedding Models: Text embedding models take text as input and return a list of floats.
