Conceptual Guide

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a core component of LangChain.
LangChain is not a provider of LLMs, but rather provides a standard interface through which
you can interact with a variety of LLMs.
The following sections of documentation are provided:

Getting Started: An overview of all the functionality the LangChain LLM class provides.
How-To Guides: A collection of how-to guides. These highlight how to accomplish various objectives with our LLM class (streaming, async, etc).
Integrations: A collection of examples on how to integrate different LLM providers with LangChain (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc).
Reference: API reference documentation for all LLM classes.
