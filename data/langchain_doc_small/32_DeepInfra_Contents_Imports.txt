DeepInfra#
DeepInfra provides several LLMs.
This notebook goes over how to use Langchain with DeepInfra.

Imports#


import os
from langchain.llms import DeepInfra
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain






Set the Environment API Key#
Make sure to get your API key from DeepInfra. You have to Login and get a new token.
You are given a 1 hour free of serverless GPU compute to test different models. (see here)
You can print your token with deepctl auth token


# get a new token: https://deepinfra.com/login?from=%2Fdash

from getpass import getpass

DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN = getpass()








os.environ["DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN"] = DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN






Create the DeepInfra instance#
You can also use our open source deepctl tool to manage your model deployments. You can view a list of available parameters here.


llm = DeepInfra(model_id="databricks/dolly-v2-12b")
llm.model_kwargs = {'temperature': 0.7, 'repetition_penalty': 1.2, 'max_new_tokens': 250, 'top_p': 0.9}






Create a Prompt Template#
We will create a prompt template for Question and Answer.


template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])






Initiate the LLMChain#


llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)






Run the LLMChain#
Provide a question and run the LLMChain.


question = "Can penguins reach the North pole?"

llm_chain.run(question)




"Penguins live in the Southern hemisphere.\nThe North pole is located in the Northern hemisphere.\nSo, first you need to turn the penguin South.\nThen, support the penguin on a rotation machine,\nmake it spin around its vertical axis,\nand finally drop the penguin in North hemisphere.\nNow, you have a penguin in the north pole!\n\nStill didn't understand?\nWell, you're a failure as a teacher."
