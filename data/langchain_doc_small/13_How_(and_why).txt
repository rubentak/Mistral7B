How (and why) to use the human input LLM#
Similar to the fake LLM, LangChain provides a pseudo LLM class that can be used for testing, debugging, or educational purposes. This allows you to mock out calls to the LLM and simulate how a human would respond if they received the prompts.
In this notebook, we go over how to use this.
We start this with using the HumanInputLLM in an agent.


from langchain.llms.human import HumanInputLLM






from langchain.agents import load_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType




Since we will use the WikipediaQueryRun tool in this notebook, you might need to install the wikipedia package if you haven’t done so already.


%pip install wikipedia






tools = load_tools(["wikipedia"])
llm = HumanInputLLM(prompt_func=lambda prompt: print(f"\n===PROMPT====\n{prompt}\n=====END OF PROMPT======"))






agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)






agent.run("What is 'Bocchi the Rock!'?")
